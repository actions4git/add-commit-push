‚ûï Adds all files by default \
üë® Uses `github.actor` as the default author \
ü§ñ Uses @github-actions\[bot\] as the default committer \
üîº Pushes changes to the current branch or tag \
üè∑Ô∏è Will automatically use `--force` if it's a Git tag

A convenience wrapper with sensible defaults so that you don't have to do
`git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` manually all the time. üòâ

## Usage

**üöÄ Here's what you want:**

```yml
on:
  pull_request:
jobs:
  job:
    permissions:
      contents: write
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npx --yes prettier --write .
      - uses: actions4git/add-commit-push@v1
```

üîí Make sure you have the `permissions` set to `contents: write`! We need to be
able to edit the repository contents to push things.

<details><summary>You can also use this GitHub Action with tags/releases</summary>

```yml
on:
  release:
    types: released
jobs:
  job:
    permissions:
      contents: write
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "$TAG" > VERSION.txt
        env:
          TAG: ${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}
      - uses: actions4git/add-commit-push@v1
```

</details>

If you're looking to have more control than the options provided below, it's
best if you tap in to the `git` CLI directly. The only tricky bit is setting a
default Git user (it's unset by default). You can either set it manually or use
a premade action like [actions4git/setup-git] to configure the `user.name` and
`user.email` settings.

```yml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4

- uses: actions4git/setup-git@v1
# OR
- run: |
    git config user.name "$GITHUB_ACTOR"
    git config user.email "$GITHUB_ACTOR_ID+$GITHUB_ACTOR@users.noreply.github.com"
# OR
- run: |
    git config user.name 'github-actions[bot]'
    git config user.email '41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com'

# Then you can do whatever you want!
- run: git add ...
- run: git rebase ...
- run: git merge ...
- run: git commit ...
- run: git push ...
```

### Inputs

- **`path`:** The path to the repository root folder to perform the Git
  operations in. This defaults to the current working directory (`.`). Change
  this to a subfolder if you are using a different folder other than the default
  `github.workspace` for your Git repository.

- **`add-pathspec`:** Additional path specifiers to be passed to `git add`.
  These can be files, folders, globs, or even some fancy Git pathspec things
  such as `:!ignoreme.txt`. Check out the CSS-Tricks [Git Pathspecs and How to
  Use Them] article for the highlights of Git pathspecs. If this input is not
  specified, `git add --all` will be used instead. Specifying `.` has slightly
  different behavior from `--all`.

- **`add-force`:** Whether or not to use the `--force` flag when performing the
  `git add` operation. Use this if you really want to add something but it's in
  your `.gitignore`. This can be useful if you ever need to commit build
  artifacts to Git that are normally ignored by your `.gitignore`. Defaults to
  `false`.

- **`commit-author`:** A `Name Here <emailhere@example.org>` AiO author name &
  email string. This is a shortcut alternative to the independent
  `commit-author-name` and `commit-author-email` options that are also
  available. This defaults to the current `github.actor`. Note that this is
  different from the `commit-committer`. [The author of a commit is who wrote
  the thing, and the committer is who committed it to Git.] It's recommended to
  leave this as the default.

- **`commit-author-name`:** The name of the author to associate with the commit.
  Should be left unspecified if `commit-author` is specified.

- **`commit-author-email`:** The email address of the author to associate with
  the commit. Should be left unspecified if `commit-author` is specified.

- **`commit-committer`:** A `Name Here <emailhere@example.org>` AiO author name
  & email string. This input is a shortcut for the `commit-committer-name` and
  `commit-committer-email` inputs that can also be individually specified. This
  defaults to the `github-actions[bot]` user which is probably what you want.
  It's recommended to change the `commit-author` before changing the
  `commit-committer`.

- **`commit-committer-name`:** The name of the committer to associate with the
  commit. Should be left unspecified if `commit-committer` is specified.

- **`commit-committer-email`:** The email address of the committer to associate
  with the commit. Should be left unspecified if `commit-committer` is
  specified.

- **`commit-message`:** The `--message` parameter to use for the commit. This
  can be a multiline string if you want to specify a title and body. The default
  is 'Automated changes'.

- **`push-repository`:** The first argument to
  `git push [repository] [refspec]`. You can change this to another remote name
  like `upstream` (as long as you have push rights) or another Git remote
  entirely like `https://github.com/octocat/another-repo.git`. The default
  `origin` is probably what you want.

- **`push-refspec`:** A specific branch or tag name to push to. If this is a
  tag, `push-force` will default to `true` unless explicitly set otherwise.
  Defaults to whatever the current Git `HEAD` target is.

- **`push-force`:** Whether or not to use the `--force` parameter when doing the
  `git push`. You may need to specify this if you are rewriting history or
  editing a tag. Defaults to `false` if the `push-refspec` is a branch and
  `true` if it's a tag.

**How do I test my changes?**

The easiest way is to open a Draft Pull Request either against the upstream
repository or against your own fork's main branch and watch the GitHub Actions
do their thing.
